Here I want to talk about a few very important statistical concepts. At the start of my degree, I always had trouble completely understading both consistency and efficiency. This wasn't because they are  difficult concepts, rather, they were never explained to me in an intuitive way. As a result, I had a rough idea of what they were but, as I didn't have a thorough appreciation for what they meant, I couldn't apply them or recognise their importance.
