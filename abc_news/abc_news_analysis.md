### Is the Australian Broadcasting Corporation politically biased against conservatives?

Many non-Australians may not know this, but Australia's media (particularly print media) is generally quite conservative, newspapers owned by Rupert Murdoch account for almost 60% of Australian daily newspaper circulation. The publicly owned ABC is an exception to this and, as a result, is often accused by conservative politicians of having a left-wing bias. Numerous inquiries and investigations have been made into this claim over the last few years, all of which concluding that the ABC is in fact not biased. However, the accusations from right-leaning Australians persist. So is this true? Is the ABC really biased against conservatives? This is an interesting and interesting question, one which I wanted to try to answer.

In ______ I found a dataset containing the headlines of every ABC news article from **19 February 2003 until 2 January 2018**. My thinking was that by comparing news articles about the two major parties I could gain an insight into how the ABC reports on eaceh party. For those that are unfamilar with Australian politics, we have two major parties - the centre-left Australian Labor Party and the conservative coalition of the (ironically named) Liberal Party and the National Party.
