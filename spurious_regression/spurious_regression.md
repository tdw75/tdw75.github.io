Formally, spurious regression (or spurious correlation) describes a mathematical relationship where two events are associated but not causally related. This can either be by chance (such in the case of the Redskins Rule in US politics) or due to some third unseen variable.

This has broad implications not only in statistics and data science, but also in everyday life. When creating statistical models, it's important to recognise such relationships so that...
But in everyday life it's also important
