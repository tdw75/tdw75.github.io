## Combinatorial Optimisation Solvers

Here is a collection of algorithms that I have written to solve various combinatorial optimisation problems. For each problem there is a link to the repository containing the source code as well as a link to a Jupyter Notebook file with examples of the alorithms in use. The notebook can either be viewed in the browser as is or, if the repository is downloaded, it can be also run with different data files to see how different algorithms perform on different variations of the problems.
