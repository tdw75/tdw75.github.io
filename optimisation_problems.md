## Discrete Optimisation Solvers

Here is a collection of algorithms that I wrote to solve various discrete optimisation problems. For each problem there is a link to the repository with the source code as well as a link to a Jupyter Notebook file with examples of the alorithms in use. The notebook can either be viewed in the browser as is or, if the repository is downloaded, it can be also run with different data files to see how different algorithms perform with different problems.
