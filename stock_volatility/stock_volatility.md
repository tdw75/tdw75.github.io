**Project description:** This was a group research project I did as part of a financial econometrics course at the University of Sydney. As it was a group project, I obviously worked with colleagues on this. The majority of the theoretical background research, stock data collection through the Bloomberg terminals, and financial analysis was done by my group mates. I did all of the coding, including the sentiment analysis and time series modelling. As such, I'll be focusing on that here. The inference was done as a group but I'll also go through that as well.

### 1. Introduction and Data Description

The goal of this project is to try to analyse the relationship between sentiment towards a company and the volatility of its stock price. More specifically, we wanted to see the effect that sentiment during the overnight period when the stock market is closed on the volatility at market open the next day. The company we used as an example is Tesla, which as a famously volatile stock, should allow for some interesting analysis.

To do this, we clearly need a few different pieces of information. First, we need some measure of sentiment towards Tesla. Second, we need data on TSLA stock as well as a benchmark to compare it against. Finally, we need some covariates to avoid problems such as omitted variable bias, whereby information of an unseen variable is present in the variable of interest, which makes the variable of interest appear to have more explanatory power than it does in reality.
