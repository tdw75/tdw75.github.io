## A statistical machine learning based pricing recommendation system for Airbnb listings in Melbourne

**Project description:** This project was completed as an assessment piece for a machine learning and data science unit at the University of Sydney. For this  assignment, we were given a data set of AirBnB listings in Melbourne and were tasked with using statistical learning methods to build a pricing recommendation system. TO create this system we first needed to clean the data, impute

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis

### 2. Data Cleaning, Processing, and Wrangling

### 3. Feature Engineering

### 4. Modelling

### 5. Analysis

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

```python
if is_awesome:
  print(true)

```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques
